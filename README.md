## üìà 3. Key Features and Visualizations

2. **Sales by Fat Content**
   ‚Üí Compares `Low Fat`, `Regular`, `LF`, and `reg` categories based on sales volume and percentage.

3. **Sales by Outlet Type and Size**
   ‚Üí Analyzes how different outlet formats (Supermarket vs Grocery Store) and sizes (Small, Medium, High) contribute to revenue.

4. **Sales by Establishment Year**
   ‚Üí Shows historical performance based on the year an outlet was established (2010‚Äì2020).

5. **Outlet Identifier Analysis**
   ‚Üí Bar chart showing the count of sales transactions by outlet IDs.

6. **Outlet Location Type Performance**
   ‚Üí Uses `Tier 1`, `Tier 2`, and `Tier 3` to measure count of sales and average sales.
